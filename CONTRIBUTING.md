## Guidelines

### Content

Each event must have a dedicated folder titled `YYYY-MM-DD-event-title/` with the following files:

- `README.md` - stick to the [template](templates/event.md)
- `assets/` - for any additional files.
  Create the following sub-folders if necessary:
  - `img/` - for images or photos taken at the event
  - `vid/` - for videos
  - `doc/` - for documents

<!-- TODO : Provide example -->

### Collaboration

- Create a branch `dev-your-github-username`.
  Use this new branch as yours.
  Avoid using the `master` branch or any other branch.

- Make a single commit for each event.

  - Avoid making multiple commits for the same event.
  - Avoid making a single commit for multiple events.

- Once commits are made locally push the changes to GitHub on your branch.
