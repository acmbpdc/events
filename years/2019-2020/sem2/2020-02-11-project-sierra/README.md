**Project: S.I.E.R.R.A.** was the very first crime scene investigation game organized by ACM.
It was a treasure hunt where participants were divided into pairs.
Each pair would have one individual working at the lab and the other looking for answers across the campus.

The event was advertised with the following poster:

A prize money of **`AED 200`** was set.

The game required a website to keep track of teams and their progress.
It was built using the [CTFd](https://ctfd.io/) platform.

Here are some pictures from the event.
